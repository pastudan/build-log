# Build-Log
Build-Log is software to enable visually focused web publishing for things with steps. 

# Why
Repairing your phone's sreen, building a projector, tutorials on animation -- these are the types of projects that can greatly benefit from high resolution, detailed, step-by-step photographs when presented clearly. I felt the web was lacking a simple, out of the way publishing platform to fit this need, so I am focused on building the most intuitive and visual platform designed for instructors and makers.
